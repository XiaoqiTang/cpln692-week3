    # Lab 1, Part 4 â€” Stretch Goal: Project Euler

    ## Introduction

    Practice your Javascript and math skills by solving a problem on Project
    Euler. Project Euler is a series of challenging math and computer science
    problems that can be solved using any language (for our class, use
    Javascript).

    Solve the first problem on this page https://projecteuler.net/archives
    (Multiples of 3 and 5). To check your answer, create an account and you will
    be able to submit your final result.

    If you complete problem 1, move on to problem 2!

    /* =====================

    Start code

    ===================== */
    //problem 1
    //If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
    //Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
    var sum = 0;
    for (i = 1; i < 1000; i++) {
        if((i%3==0)||(i%5==0)) {
            sum=i+sum
        }
    };


    //problem 2
    //Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
    //By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
    var sequence =[1,2];
    var i=0;
    while (sequence[i]+sequence[i+1] <= 4000000) {
        sequence.push(sequence[i]+sequence[i+1]);
        i+=1;
    }

    var sum2 = 0;
    for(i=0; i<sequence.length; i++){
        if(sequence[i]%2==0){
            sum2+=sequence[i]
        }
    }
